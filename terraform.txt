Components of terraform

	1. Provider --> is defined to interact the cloud providers like cloud provider name, access keys
	2. Resource --> where we define infrastructure details that we want deploy like Compute, virtual network, storage.
			In one resource block we can define one or more infrastructure details.
	3. Variables --> variable.tf is a separate file to store variable.
	4. Statefile --> After deployment terraform creates a state file with name terraform.tfstate to keep track of current state.
	5. Provisioners --> where we can define additional steps to run after the infrastructure deployment done like, executing scripts, installing packages, copying file.

Commands:
---------

Terraform init  ---> First we need to run this command so that it will download the provider information from terraform website and keep it in .terraform folder.
		     We can't do any thing without running this command, which is must and should.

Terraform plan  ---> by executing this command, shows what is going to deploy which we define in code.
		     And also create a statefile which have the information of current state of our cloud.

Terraform apply  ---> This command start deployment the infrastructure in the cloud.
